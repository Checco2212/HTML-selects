The languages select is the first code uploaded to this page. It was created based on the ISO 639-1 standard and a JSON version of it by the Github user jrnk. I just fixed a couple of special characters that got wrongly encoded and added the "Most common" section, based on the 2018 study by w3techs.com about the "Usage of content languages for websites".
